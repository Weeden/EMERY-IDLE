***EMERY IDLE BY JAXARIAH***
As of V.05 I want to clean up the code, fix the current bugs, and add some beter game play and real logic.
1. Add Local saving and maybe profiles/accounts to save progress.
2. Create "Dashboard" landing page that allows character creation. 
3. fix tabs that are all loading at the same time.... had this fixed in a version i lost.
